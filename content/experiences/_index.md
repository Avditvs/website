## Machine Learning Engineer - Ipsos Synthesio
*January 2022 - Today*
![image](ipsos-logo.resized.png)

Building, evaluating and deploying multilingual NLP models for sentiment analysis, Named Entity Recognition, noise detection,
clustering and others for very large scale social and survey data using cutting edge machine learning technologies (transformers, huggingface, pytorch...)

Implemented a fully functional and evaluated Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Large Language Models
(OpenAI GPT models and open source models) and advanced indexing/querying techniques.
Decreased time to deliver insights using social data by **10 times**..
Development and deployment of Python APIs to serve the built models and add them to the enrichment pipelines.

The main challenges were to implement models that can sustain the high throughput of data ( more than 1000 texts per second) and to
ensure the quality of the models in a multilingual context.

Also improved the model workflow by implementing a lifecycle with experiment tracking, dataset versioning, model versioning and deployment.


## Consutant - Aerow
*August 2021 - January 2022*

Realization of personalized document workflows using the OpenText ContentServer solution, AnswerModules technology and the Apache Groovy programming language.

Mainly worked on a validation automation for Laboratoires Boiron, a pharmaceutical company.

## Machine Learning Engineer - Aubay
*February 2021 - July 2021*

Study of methods for automatic document summarization using Natural Language Processing models. (BERT, BART, Transformers)
Two methods were tested: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization. The first one consists of selecting the most important sentences of a document, while the second one consists of generating a summary from scratch.

We also tested and benchmarked proprietary and open-source speech-to-text methods (Wav2Vec).

Finally we worked on an demonstration application to serve the summarization and speech-to-text models in a user-friendly way.


## Software Developper - PIC Quicksign
*January 2021 - January 2021*

Developper withng the INSA Entreprise Project with [QuickSign](https://www.quicksign.com/fr/), focusing on fraud detection and document manipulation using machine learning algorithms.
We specifically dug into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build classifiers that can detect modified documents. We also worked on the development of tools that synthetically generate images of documents to train our models.

Within this agile team of 9 students, I also held the position of network maintainer, which consists of setting up and maintaining the proper functioning of the various networking services essential to the project.

The project had a strict quality assurance process close to ISO 9001 standards, which allowed me to learn a lot about the importance of quality in software development.
